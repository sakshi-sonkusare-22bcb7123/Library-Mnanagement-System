#  🏟️ Java Library Management System

## 🚩 Objective

Build a **console-based Library Management System** using Java that allows users to register, issue books, return books, and view available books and registered users. The project is object-oriented and simulates basic library operations in a simple and interactive way.

## 🛴 Key Concepts Used

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation
- **Java Collections**
  - `ArrayList`
- **Control Structures**
  - `do-while`, `switch-case`, `for` loops
- **User Input**
  - `Scanner`
- **CLI Menus**

## 🦜 What I Learned
- How to model real-world entities (Books, Users) using Java classes.
- How to manage relationships between objects (issuing a book to a user).
- Working with ArrayList to store dynamic data.
- Implementing interactive command-line interfaces.
-  Using Scanner for robust user input handling.
- Writing clean, modular, and object-oriented code.
